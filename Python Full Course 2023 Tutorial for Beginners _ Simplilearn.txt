First Python Program in command prompt:
Basic program for division:
a=5
b=10
c=b/a
print(c)

Write a program in Python IDLE:
Below are the steps to follow to write and execute the python program in python IDLE.
1. Open Python IDLE, 
2. Click on "File Menu" and choose "New File"
3. Type the program and save it with ".py" extension
4. Click on "Run" Menu and then click on "Run Module"

Example:
a=int(input("Enter first number:"))
b=int(input("Enter second number:"))
c=a+b
print("Addition of two numbers=",c)
#save, go to Run, Run Module --->
#All the statements in the program get executed line by line.

Write a Python program in Jupyter Notebook:
Example:
a=int(input("Enter first number:"))
b=int(input("Enter second number:"))
c=int(input("Enter Third number:"))
d=a*b*c
print("Multiplication of three numbers:",d)


Variables in Python:
Python variables are containers for storing data values. Example: car="BMW"
Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line. Example: x,y,z="Audi","BMW","Mercedes"

a=50, b=a (a and b are the variables and 50 is object)

Rules for Python Variable naming:
1. A Variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
2. A variable name can't start with a number
3. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters or underscores (A-z,0-9,and _)
4. A variable names are case-sensitive (date, Date and DATE are three different variables)
5. There are several techniques to write multi words variables. Example: Camel case,  Pascal case, Snake case.
6. we can't use python keywords as Variable names.

Examples:
a=50
type(a)
id(a)
print(a)

a=100
id(a)

x,y,z = 50, 168.6, "Simplilearn"
type(y)
type(z)
x = y = z = 10 ---> 
(x,y,z) = 10, 10, 10 --->

x = "Simplilearn"
print("Welcome to " + x)



Data Types in Python:
1. Numeric Types (int, float, & complex)
2. Sequence Types (list, tuple, & range)
3. Text Type (str)
4. Mapping Type (dict)
5. Set Type (set) -- Unordered collection of unique items
6. Boolean Type (bool)
7. Binary Types (bytes, bytearray, & memoryview)


Object Types in Python:
1. Lists

9. Other core types
10. Implementation related types

Types of Type Conversion in Python:
1. Implicit Type Conversion
2. Explicit Type Conversion [int(a, base), float(), ord(), hex(), oct(), tuple(), set(), list(), dict(), str(), complex(real, imag), chr(number)]. Syntax: <required_datatype>(expression)


Different Data Types:
Types of Number Data Types:  int, float, & complex.

Type Conversion Between Numbers in Python: 
1. Using Arithmetic Operations (Implicit Conversion).
2. Using Built-in functions (Explicit Conversion).

Representation of Binary, Hexadecimal & Octal in Python:
Binary -- 0b or 0B
Octal  -- 0o or 0O
Hexadecimal -- 0x or 0X


String in Python:
A String is a sequence of characters. In Python, we have str as a data type for string.
Strings can be defined by surrounding characters inside single or double quotes.

Examples for Strings:
str1='Simplilearn'
str2="Lets us learn python"
str3='''Hai Everyone
welcome to Python
strings tutorial class''' ----> this is multiline string

print("{} and {} both are best friends". format("James","Bred"))
print("{1} and {0} both are best friends". format("James","Bred"))
print("{a} and {b} both are best friends". format(a="James",b="Bred"))

name='Angela'
salary=10000
print("Her name is %s\nHer salary is %d"%(name,salary))


str1='simplilearn'
str2=str1.capitalize()
print("Old value:", str1)
print("New value:", str2)

str1='SIMPLILEARN'
str2=str1.casefold()
print("Old value:", str1)
print("New value:", str2)

str1='sImpliLeaRn'
str2=str1.upper()
print("Old value:", str1)
print("New value:", str2)

str1='SIMPLILEARN'
str2=str1.title()
print("Old value:", str1)
print("New value:", str2)

str1='Hamburg is located in Germany'
str2=str1.split()
print(str1)
print(str2)

Bitwise Operators ---> &, |, >>, <<, ~
Identity Operators ---> is, is not
Membership Operators ---> in, not in

Characteristics of List:
1. The Lists are ordered
2. Lists are mutable
3. Lists can store various types of elements
4. Elements of the list can be accessed by index

A tuple can be defined as a collection of objects, values, or items of different types and these collections are enclosed within circle brackets() and separated by commas(,).

Characteristics of Tuples:
1. The Tuples are ordered.
2. Tuples are immutable.
3. Tuples can store various types of elements.
4. Elements of the Tuples can be accessed by index.
5. Tuples allow duplicate elements.

Methods in Tuple:

2. Slicing: Tup1[range]
3. Concatenation: Tup1+Tup2
4. Repetition: Tup1*x
5. Count: Tup1.count(elem)


Dictionaries in Python:
Python Dictionary can be defined as a collection of objects, values or items of different types stored in key-value pair format. These multiple key-value pairs created are enclosed within the curly braces{}, and each key is separated from its value by the colon(:).

Characteristics of Dictionaries:
1. The Dictionaries are ordered from python version 3.7

  # elif statement
}
else:
{ 
  # else statement
}

state = input("Enter the state name in USA: ")
if state == "Texas":
    if total <= 150:
        print("Shipping Cost in Texas is $30")
    elif total > 150 and total <=250:
       print("Shipping Cost in Texas is $20")
    else:
        print("Shipping Cost in Texas is $5")

elif state == "Florida":
    if total <= 150:

While Loop:
The while loop in Python iterates over a part of code until the specified condition is true.

Syntax:
while expression:
       statement(s)

Examples:
i = 0
while i < 10:
    i = i+1
    print(i, end=" ")
    print()

count = 0
while count <= 5:
    print("The condition is true", count)
    count = count+1
print("End of the loop")



For Loop:
What is a For Loop in Python?
For loop has the potential to iterate over the items present in a sequence, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, or strings.

A for loop uses the range() function to iterate for a specific amount of time.

Syntax of a For Loop: 
for iterator_var in sequence:
         statement(s)
Rest of the code


s = 'Simplilearn'
for i in s:
    print(i)

s = 'Simplilearn'
for i in s:
    print(i, end="*")
